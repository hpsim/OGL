A wrapper for [ginkgo](https://github.com/ginkgo-project/ginkgo) solver to provide GPGPU capabilities to [OpenFOAM](https://openfoam.org/)

## Requirements

OGL has the following requirements

*   _cmake 3.9+_
*   _OpenFOAM 6+_
*   _Ginkgo 1.4.0+_
*   C++14 compliant compiler

See also [ginkgo's](https://github.com/ginkgo-project/ginkgo) documentation for additional requirements.

## Compilation

*OGL* can be build using cmake following the standard cmake procedure. 

    mkdir build && cd build && ccmake ..

By default *OGL* will fetch and build ginkgo, to specify which backend should be build you can use the following cmake flags `-DGINKGO_BUILD_CUDA`, ` -DGINKGO_BUILD_OMP`, or ` -DGINKGO_BUILD_HIP`. For example to build *OGL* with *CUDA* and *OMP* support use

    cmake -DGINKGO_BUILD_CUDA=ON -DGINKGO_BUILD_OMP=ON ..

Then, make sure that the `system/controlDict` includes the `OGL.so` file:

    libs ("libOGL.so");


## Usage

OGL solver support the same syntax as the default *OpenFOAM* solver. Thus, to use a `CG` solver you can simply replace `PCG` by `GKOCG`. In order to run either with *CUDA*, *HIP*, or *OMP* support set the `executor` to `cuda`, `hip`, or `omp` in the  `system/fvSolution` dictionary.

Currently, the following solver are supported

* CG with and without block Jacobi preconditioner
* BiCGStab
* IR

The following optional solver arguments are supported

Argument | Default | Description
------------ | ------------- | -------------
updateSysMatrix | true | whether to copy the system matrix to device on every solver call
updateInitVector | false |whether to copy the initial guess to device on every solver call
sort | true | sort the system matrix
executor | reference | the executor where to solve the system matrix, other options are `omp`, `cuda`
export | false | write the complete system to disk
verbose | false | print out extra info

## Known Limitations

Currently cyclic boundary conditions are not supported.

## Citing

When using OGL please cite the main Ginkgo paper describing Ginkgo's purpose, design and interface, which is
